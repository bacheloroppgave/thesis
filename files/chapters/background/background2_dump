\section{Planning phase}
Planning the new Autograder took many iterations of design and layout. The programming phase is simplified if all the layout has been planned ahead. All actions, tasks and functions of the site must be mapped out. New functionality must also be incorporated into the new design. The next section will show how the new layout has been planned and designed.

The more traditional way of designing a website is to start with wireframes. Wireframes are basic sketches or mockups of the design. The most basic forms does not include colors or advanced shapes. Simple boxes and rectangles are used to get a feel for how the page will look and function. The process starts with a revisit of the old Autograder front-end. All functions and tasks of all users must be mapped out. This includes functions such as approval of labs, signing in, making groups etc. The tasks are mapped using a technique called \emph{User Stories}. User stories are verbal guides to map all functionality. Stories come in the form \emph{"As a <role>, I want to <goal> so that <benefit>"}. Here are some of the user stories that Autograder uses;

\begin{itemize*}
\item As a student i want to create new group, so that other students can join for group assignment.
\item As an admin I want to list all current students so that I can manage permissions (admin,teacher,student).
\item As a teacher I want to archive / delete course, so that I can see only relevant and active courses.
\end{itemize*}

User stories help plan the whole system. The order of which functions are implemented can be managed from the start. In Autograder's case, functions like listing labs for the teacher will be a high priority user story. Functions like changing the group names can wait until a later point in development. Using a spreadsheet such as Excel to write the user stories is a productive way of planning the page. Each role of the page, i.e students, teachers and admins can be placed in different columns. User stories for each column is then written in rows. Trello was used, because of the "card"-design that the page has. Moving the cards is made easy through a drag-and-drop interface. This makes the job of managing the user stories much more simple, and it can also be used throughout the development as a TODO list.

The above image shows how we used Trello as a tool in the development process. The user stories are written down as cards. The cards can then be moved around. User stories can also be used to make Wireframes. As said, students, teachers and admins each have their own user stories. The stories are usually drawn into wireframes with the client present. In our case, we talked to Professor Hein Meling at UiS, which acted as the client for the new Autograder. Pages such as the results view \worry{ref til figur/wireframe} went though many iterations before landing on the final layout.
