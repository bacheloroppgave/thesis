\chapter{Planning and design}
When developing an application, the standard thing to do is to focus on user experience. What will the software you are developing be used for, and by whom. Usual approach is to come up with use cases, draw wireframes and a design that is supposed to give the best user experience.
\section{Wireframes}
Creating wireframes is a crucial part of user interface design. The point of wireframes is to have something that is easier to change than the code you are going to write. Before coming to the programming phase, one can iterate over a lot more design propositions, and is able to change things up easily during this initial or plannign phase. \newline
During this project a software development methodology called scrum was used, this helps manage product development process significantly. In scrum, planning phase never ends, there is a endless loop of planning and implementation as the project develops \newline
