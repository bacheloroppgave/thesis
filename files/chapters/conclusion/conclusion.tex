\section{Conclusion}
This report explains the process behind creating a better and more responsive user interface and proposes a new user interface design for Autograder system developed at UiS. The technologies used in the solutions - mainly ReactJS and Flux, are one of the most recent frameworks in web and user interface development. By working with those frameworks it bacame clear that they are very good for creating application specific software and user interface. Since they are quite new frameworks, a significant amount of time had to be used for research and prototyping to learn them. This only reduced the amount of things that would otherwise be implemented. The end result was a very good front-end system, that follows strict Flux architecture. Most of the functionality of the old Autograder can now be implemented into the new front-end solution.
