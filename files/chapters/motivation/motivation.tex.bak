\chapter{Motivation}

When larning a new programming language, quick feedback is the key. Student should be able to get feedback in relatively short time, where it should be easy to see mistakes that were made and get relevant feedback from the teacher. A student should be able to submit code in an easy fashion and somehow run and debug the code. The results should be shown in a simple way, where the teacher can add comments or somehow view the code that the students submit. The current front end is created with a web based system and a server side that handles the logic. The current system completes many of the goals of the author, however, there are some problems that needs to be addressed. One of the goals of the original author is to simplify the process of grading the assignments. The number of students in a course can range from a small class of 10 students to a big class of 30-40 students. The system as of now works great with smaller classes, however, when that number increases, some problems appear. We will therefore revisit these parts of the system and improve it. We will also predict how the system will be used in the future, so that the front end can still work even though the back end systems might be rewritten. The system should work both for small classes and bigger classes. The front end should not be the limiting factor when choosing a programming language. In addition, it should also be a fun and productive experience both for student and teachers, rather than limiting. Furthermore, there have been questions about mobile solutions and other feature of the page. Now that the system is maturing it will be a natural progression to think about mobile solutions. In the ever growing mobile-market, an increasing number of hand-held devices have been introduced to the market, and users will expect this to be integrated in the Autograder system. We will therefore have this in mind when creating the new Autograder front end.

The advanced programming courses usually consists of multiple assignments with short deadlines. The quality of the feedback can vary depending on a number of factors. To help teachers and students with removing some of these factors, the Autograder system removes a lot overhead work. The original Autograder has been used on a number of courses at bachelor and master level. This enables us to talk to student and teachers about the current system, and ways we can improve it. The authors of the new Autograder front end has already used the system in the course "Operativsystemer", and have thoughts on how the new system can be improved compared to the old one. 
We propose a new Autograder front end system as well as some back end, to not only streamline the work flow for student and teachers, but improve responsiveness of the page.
