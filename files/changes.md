Changes made on intro:
- changed the language. Fixed the problems with the grammar
- changed the argument, as Hein commented in the code.
  (fixed page 1 - 3)

- Writing about mobile solutions:
  -> increasing number of mobile devices
  -> design for all platforms
  -> Grading for the teachers on the fly
  -> This will extend over to the motivation chapter (as Hein commented, it was mentioned in the motivation for the first time)

Changes made to motivation:
- Changed the grammar
- Wrote some more on the mobile-solution section of the chapter

Changes made to background

CHAPTER 1: Background
- Intro (done)
- Planning phase, User stories and wireframes.
	-> Added figure that should maybe be changed (?)
	-> Move some of the stuff from the design chapter to the background

	-> We do not need to use the background chapter 
		more than it should be used.
